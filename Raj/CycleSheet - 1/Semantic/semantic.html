            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                World War I (28 July 1914 – 11 November 1918), also known as the Great War,
                was a global conflict between the Allies and the Central Powers.
                It involved Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia-Pacific.
                The war introduced modern warfare technologies and resulted in
                millions of military and civilian casualties.

            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>
                The war was caused by rising nationalism, imperial rivalries,
                militarism, and complex alliances. The assassination of Archduke
                Franz Ferdinand in 1914 triggered a chain reaction of war declarations
                across Europe, eventually drawing many nations into the conflict.
