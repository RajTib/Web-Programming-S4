# 🌐 Web Programming – Semester 4

Welcome to this repository 👋
This is a shared workspace where we store our **Web Programming class code, experiments, and mini-projects**, built while learning and exploring the web stack during Semester 4.

Think of this repo as:
- a **code notebook**
- a **practice ground**
- and a **living archive** of how our understanding of web development evolves over time

No perfection. Just progress.

## 📁 What You’ll Find Here

- 🧩 **Class Codes**
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript examples written during lectures and labs.

- 🎨 **CSS Experiments**
  Box model, selectors, layouts, cascading behavior, and other styling concepts we break and rebuild until they make sense.

- 🛠️ **Mini Projects & Practice Files**
  Small projects and hands-on exercises to apply concepts practically.

- 📚 **Extra Learnings**
  Notes, examples, or implementations inspired by:
  - YouTube tutorials
  - Online articles
  - Random “wait… what if?” moments

If it helps us understand better, it belongs here.

## 🤝 Collaboration Style

This repository is maintained by:
- **Raj**
- a friend who’s on the same learning grind 💪

We use it to:
- share code
- compare approaches
- learn from each other’s mistakes
- and slowly get better at writing clean, understandable web code

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists

Web development is best learned by:
- writing code ✍️
- breaking things 💥
- fixing them 🔧
- and documenting the journey

This repo isn’t about being fancy — it’s about being **consistent and curious**.

---

## 🚀 Future Plans (Maybe 👀)

- Better folder organization
- Small full-page projects
- Improved CSS layouts
- Cleaner JS logic
- A glow-up as our skills level up

---

## 📝 Note

This repository is primarily for **learning and practice**.
If something looks messy, unfinished, or experimental — that’s intentional.

Progress > perfection.

Happy coding 🌱
